Another life, another love
Another kill, another drug
Another touch, another taste
Another night, another war
Another "What are we fighting for?"
Another lost to bitter pain

Is everybody out here crazy?
Anybody want a war, war?
Everybody out here crazy, crazy
Hail to the victor
Another dusk, another dawn
Another game, another god
Another day to buy your fate
Took a left to right a wrong
Another battle in Babylon
